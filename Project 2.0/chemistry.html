            <h2>1. Introduction to Chemistry</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Basic Concepts</h3>
            <p>Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, and how it interacts with other matter. It provides a foundation for understanding the natural world and is essential in various engineering fields.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atoms and Molecules:</strong> An atom is the smallest unit of an element, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Molecules are formed when two or more atoms bond together. The mole concept is a fundamental principle that relates the mass of a substance to the number of particles it contains.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Bonds:</strong> Chemical bonds are interactions that hold atoms together in a molecule. 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Ionic Bonds:</em> Formed when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in oppositely charged ions.</li>
                        <li><em>Covalent Bonds:</em> Formed when two atoms share electrons.</li>
                        <li><em>Metallic Bonds:</em> Characterized by a sea of shared electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stoichiometry:</strong> The study of the quantitative relationships in chemical reactions. Key concepts include balancing chemical equations, understanding molar mass, and performing calculations involving moles, mass, and volume.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 States of Matter</h3>
            <p>Matter exists in different states, primarily solid, liquid, and gas. The behavior of these states can be explained by kinetic molecular theory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gases:</strong> Gases have no fixed shape or volume. The Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT) relates pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T) with the amount of substance (n).</li>
                <li><strong>Liquids:</strong> Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. Properties such as viscosity, surface tension, and vapor pressure are crucial in understanding liquid behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Solids:</strong> Solids have a fixed shape and volume. They can be crystalline (ordered structure) or amorphous (disordered structure). The arrangement of particles in solids determines their properties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Thermodynamics</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>
            <p>Thermodynamics is the study of energy transfer and transformations. The laws of thermodynamics govern physical and chemical processes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Law:</strong> The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This law introduces the concept of internal energy (U), heat (q), and work (w) in systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> Entropy (S) is a measure of disorder or randomness. The second law states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and processes occur in the direction of increasing entropy.</li>
                <li><strong>Thermodynamic Functions:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Enthalpy (H):</em> A measure of total heat content in a system; it accounts for internal energy and the product of pressure and volume.</li>
                        <li><em>Gibbs Free Energy (G):</em> Defined as G = H - TS (where T is temperature), it indicates the spontaneity of processes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Applications of Thermodynamics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase Equilibria:</strong> Phase diagrams illustrate the states of matter at different temperatures and pressures. Understanding the triple point and critical point is essential in predicting phase changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Equilibria:</strong> The concept of dynamic equilibrium occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it will adjust to counteract the disturbance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Chemical Kinetics</h2>

                <li><strong>Factors Affecting Reaction Rates:</strong> Several factors influence how fast a reaction occurs:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Concentration:</em> Higher concentrations of reactants generally lead to increased reaction rates.</li>
                        <li><em>Temperature:</em> Increasing temperature typically speeds up reactions by providing more energy to the particles.</li>
                        <li><em>Surface Area:</em> Finely divided solids react faster than larger chunks due to increased surface area for collisions.</li>
                        <li><em>Catalysts:</em> Substances that increase reaction rates without being consumed in the process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Order of Reactions:</strong> The order of a reaction is determined by the exponent of the concentration of a reactant in the rate law. 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Zero Order:</em> Rate is independent of the concentration of reactants.</li>
                        <li><em>First Order:</em> Rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one reactant.</li>
                        <li><em>Second Order:</em> Rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of one reactant or the product of the concentrations of two reactants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rate Laws:</strong> The mathematical expression that relates the reaction rate to the concentration of reactants. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant to temperature and activation energy.</li>
            </ul>
